b. Public API used:
In the project, I used the "Random User API" to fetch a list of random user profiles that have already booked a hotel. It can be found in the Dashboard Section that only the owners have access to it. 

Purpose
The goal of the public API was to simulate the presence of real users in the booking dashboard and show how a frontend system can interact with a public API to fetch dynamic data in real time.

What was implemented
- A `RandomUsers` component was created that sends a request to the API to fetch a list of 5 random users.
- The API response contains user data such as:
  - First and last name
  - Email address
  - Location (city and country)
  - Profile picture

How it was displayed:
The random users were shown inside a table in the "Recent Bookings" section.

Error Handling:
- If the API call fails (e.g., network issues), a fallback message "Failed to fetch users" is displayed.
- If the API returns an empty list, a message is shown to indicate there are no users available.

This integration demonstrates:
- Use of `axios` and `useEffect` for API calls
- Dynamic rendering using React state
- Error/empty-state handling
- UI consistency

How to open the Project:
  To open the project few easy steps must be taken into consideration:
  - First you open the project the terminal or the prompt command 
  - Second you should check where you have downloaded the project, let's say on your desktop.. so you must write these command
  cd desktop (the location where the project is downloaded)
  cd hotel booking

  then npm run dev, that will generate the URL that appears (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the application in your browser.

Responsive Design & Flexibility
The entire QuickStay interface is built with responsive design principles, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.

d. Custom Requirement Explanation 
Custom Feature: Hero Section with Overlay Text and Call-to-Action

As part of the project's customization requirements, I designed and implemented a Hero section that is visually engaging and functional:

-Background Image Overlay: A full-screen background image sets a luxurious tone for the website using CSS bg-cover and bg-center.

-Overlay Text: The heading and subheading are placed on top of the image using flexible layout classes to ensure readability and responsiveness.

-Call-to-Action Form: A responsive and interactive form is placed within the hero section, allowing users to:

-Select a destination (using a datalist of predefined cities)

-Choose check-in and check-out dates

-Choose check-in and check-out dates

This section is the first thing users see on the homepage and helps guide them into the booking flow, improving both user engagement and usability.
